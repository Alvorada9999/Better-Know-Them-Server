Call some friends and play the game [here](https://better-know-them.herokuapp.com/).
See the front-end code [here](https://github.com/Kenedy-Henrique/Better-Know-Them).

Do you want to know the honest opinion of your peers or say something but you are afraid of their reaction? So this is perfect for you!

Or do you want to ask a question about something or even about yourself to find out who are the ones who know you best? So this is also perfect for you!

Or do you just want to ask silly questions and have fun with your friends' even more silly answers? So, you know.

How it works:

A room is created, when there are more than 2 people it starts automatically.

Every 30 seconds:

1 - A person asks a question

2 - User responses to the previous question are shown

3 - Nobody knows who's who

4 - The answers are always shown in random order (They are inside squares that in turn are inside a space shown on the screen), so the user's answer does not stay in the same place so that there are no patterns that can be analyzed.

You can say what you want about who you want, asking and answering what you want.
